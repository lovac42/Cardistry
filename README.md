# Cardistry: Dynamically Add New Cards

## About:
This addon adjusts how many new card will be dealt out during review depending on the current outstanding number of young and learning cards in a given deck. It will increase or decrease the daily limit as cards matures or lapses. This ensures that a user will not be juggling more than (n) amount of young/learning cards in a given period.


Please note that parent's new card limit must be larger than child's subdeck limit as Anki enforces parent deck limits first.


## Configs:
Enable using deck menu options.
